# STADS Datathon 2025 🧬📊

This repository contains the code, analysis, and results for the STADS Datathon 2025. It includes a demographic and health data analysis combined with an interactive modeling approach using a framework that simulates targeted vaccination campaigns. Specifically, the project leverages an advanced model that simulates flu vaccination strategies in Germany by identifying flu risk groups, evaluating vaccination coverage, and optimizing vaccine distribution. This is done with the support of LLMs and reinforcement learning. More can be found in the slides. It also features exploratory data analysis and visualizations to support decision-making and interpretation.
